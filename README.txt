## Project Objective

The objective of the project is to create an UNO Flip card game. Uno Flip is a variation of the classic Uno card game, and we aim to provide an interactive and user-friendly experience for players.

## Project Milestones

### Milestone 1 (Completed)

In this first milestone, we successfully developed a playable text-based version of the UNO card game. Players can interact with the game through the console using keyboard input. This milestone includes the following features:

- Player Range: The ability to play the UNO game with 2 - 4 players. 
- Card Visibility: The ability to display the cards in the current player's hand.
- Official Notation: The cards are all labeled using official UNO card notation as specified on the wikipedia page. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_Flip!)
- Draw Method: The ability to draw a card if the player has no playable cards in their hand. 
- Special Card Actions: 
	- Reverse Card: Reverses the order of playing
	- Skip Card: Skips the turn of the player who is meant to play next. 
	- Wild Card: Allows a player to choose the current colour of the playing cards.
	- Wild Draw Two Card: Allows a player to choose the current colour of the playing cards, and gives the player playing next two more cards.
	- Draw One Card: Allows a player to skip the next player's turn, in addition to making them pick up one card.
- Card State Observation: Display the resultant state of the cards in a text format. 
- Card Placement Validation: Ensures that the placement of the cards is valid based on the rules of the UNO Flip game. 
- Scoring: The ability to add and update the scores of each player currently playing. 
- Testing: The program has been tested using JUnit tests, to ensure a functional program. 

### Milestone 2 (Completed)

For this milestone, we successfully transitioned the UnoGame from a text-based version to a GUI-based version of the game. The updates include the addition of a View and a Controller, and they enable a graphical display within a JFrame. User interaction is now accepted through mouse input, ensuring a more user-friendly experience.

We've also designed and implemented unit tests Model, the tests focus on card placement, scoring, and penalty points. These tests are important to ensure proper game functionality.

## Deliverables:

- Readme file (updated to include Milestone 2)
- Design changes and explanations for UML and data structures from Milestone 1
- Corresponding unit tests
- Code (source + executable in a jar file)
- Documentation

### Milestone 3 (Planned)
For the third milestone, we aim to integrate the Uno Flip card features into the game, implementing specific rules and scoring rules. Additionally, we will introduce a computer player, allowing the game to accommodate a play alone feature.

### Milestone 4 (Planned)
In the final milestone, we will incorporate redo capabilities and replay capabilities. Players will have the ability to redo/undo their moves within the game, and they can replay the game, allowing them to play the perfect match and enjoy multiple rounds. We will also implement save/load features using Java Serialization, enabling players to save their current game progress and later resume it.

## Deliverables

Deliverables are to be delivered all in one zip file.

- Readme file
- Code (source + executable in a jar file)
- UML diagrams
- Documentation
